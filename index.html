    Hey, I'm Greg.  I'm a software engineer/developer/what-have-you
    in Clinton, MS.  I've been working in software development since
    2004, when I finished my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.
    I've spent most of my career in the US federal government, but
    did a stint in private industry as well.

    Here's where I blog (probably infrequently and about disinteresting
    stuff), but also a place where I can keep a resume updated just
    in case I need it.  It's nice to be able to point people at your
    website and say, "Hey, go look there."
