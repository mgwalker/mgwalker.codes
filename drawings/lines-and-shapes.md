# Disconnected lines and shapes

I've been playing with a character style that is creatures composed of shapes
connected by lines with gaps in them. I don't know if there's a name for it,
but I thought it was kind of cute so I ran with it. Originally I did them in
pen, but since I switched to iPad, these are the ones I've done.
