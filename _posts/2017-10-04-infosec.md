My wonderful colleague [Steven Reilly](https://twitter.com/stvnrlly) (who
might be a robot) started a series of "tech times" for the 18F Acquisitions
team (officially TTS Office of Acquisition, I think, but whatever).  The
goal was to explain software and dev stuff to our non-dev teammates, like
PMs, contracting officers, and so on.  It was a cool series and I wanted
to get in on the fun.

So I dove into my trunk to see if there were any subjects I might have a
little deeper background on and could do my own "tech time" for the team.
I landed on information assurance.  It's a subject I really enjoy, though
admittedly I'm not super deep on it, nor am I a practitioner (beyond what
any developer ought to be).  Anyway, I put together a presentation to give
to my coworkers, and I thought it'd be cool to share here, too.

The presentation is hosted on [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/),
a government Jekyll platform.  It's built with
[remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1), and the [source code is on Github](https://github.com/18F/acq-tech-presentations/tree/master/tech-theory-time/information-assurance).
