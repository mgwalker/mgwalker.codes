  <p>
    A presentation I put together for my colleagues on the acquisitions team
    to explain information assurance at a high level.  It's built in
    <a href="https://remarkjs.com/#1">remark</a>, so after it loads, you can
    press <code>?</code> to pull up some commands, including <code>p</code> to
    toggle into presenter mode so you can see the notes.
