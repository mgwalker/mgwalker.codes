I've never really kept a blog before, and I don't know if I
will this time, either.  But this is an excuse to play with
Jekyll, and since I've got stuff on AWS anyway, it's also an
excuse to play around with that some more.

## About me

I'm a nerd who enjoys tinkering with software, helping others
understand just what the heck it is I do, playing with my dog,
and watching awful movies with my husband.  Kansas City is
home, and I'm pretty happy to be here.

I've been doing software stuff professionally since the summer
of 2003, and for fun since...  uh...  1994?  I don't know,
whenever I started learning QBASIC on my grandparents' IBM PS/2.
I've worked as an IT researcher for the
[US Army Corps of Engineers](http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/ITL/)
for around 8 years, and most recently joined [18F](https://18f.gov)
in January 2016.  I did a 4-year stint in private industry, too.

## Conclusion

Right?  Because I need to have a conclusion.  Conclusion: maybe
there will be more in the future!
