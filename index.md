# A Kansas City software nerd

Hi. I'm Greg, and I'm a software nerd. I've been working professionally in
software development since around 2004, though as a hobby it goes back to
sometime in the mid 1990s when I started tinkering with BASIC on my
grandparents' IBM PS/2. It was fun learning all the cool things I could make
the computer do, like draw boxes and play sounds.

Since then, I've mostly been in the federal civil service, working at a
[US Army Corps of Engineers research lab](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/ITL/)
(it's more mundane than it sounds) and now
at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) in the
[General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov/). I did a brief tour in
private industry and realized that I very much preferred working for some
public good over making someone else rich.

My work has given me the chance to work in a variety of fields, including
disaster response, force protection, enterprise data management, child welfare,
and Medicaid. All these different fields with different needs at different
times have also given me the opportunity to work with a lot of programming
languages: C++, .NET, and Javascript have been my primaries, but I've also
needed to play in Python, Ruby, Java, and Objective-C along the way.

The thing that has surprised me in the last couple of years is learning just
how much I enjoy teaching people who aren't software experts about what we do.
It isn't magic, and demystifying it helps everyone else make better decisions
about what software to buy or how to build the systems they need. Plus,
frankly, welcoming more people into this world is just plain fun.

What's this site for, though? I don't know. I wanted the domain, honestly, and
now that I have it, I figured I should put something here. Using it as a place
to store off the blog posts I've written at 18F, and maybe the slides for some
of the talks I've prepared, seemed like a good idea. Then I thought I could
put my resume here too. So, that's what I've done. And that's what this is.
