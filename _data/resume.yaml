work:
  - title: Software engineer
    employer: 18F
    time: January 2016 - present
    intro: >-
      I primarily worked in a consulting capacity, initially as a software
      development technical lead on acquisitions projects and later as a
      consultant directly with our partner agencies.  In June 2018, I was
      named backend dev lead for 18F.
    bullets:
      - I served as a software development expert on procurements, helping set
        the technical requirements, draft procurement documents, select
        vendors, and help the product team oversee vendor performance.
      - I worked with state partners on planning modernizations of their child
        welfare IT systems.  My role was largely to help them think through
        what a new system would look like and how they'd go about building it
        using modern techniques and approaches.
      - I worked with state partners on modernizing their Medicaid
        mechnization systems (MMIS) as well as their eligibility and enrollment
        systems (E&E).  My primary responsibilities were to help the states
        understand what they needed and then show them how they could do it,
        ranging from teaching them about agile development to devops to vendor
        selection.
      - I led development on a tool for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
        Services to streamline the process by which states request federal
        funding for their Medicaid IT systems.
  - title: Computer engineer
    employer: US Army Corps of Engineers
    time: June 2011 - January 2016
    bullets:
      - I developed of a mobile app to collect and submit registrations for the
        Blue Roof program, which puts tarps on damaged roofs after a major wind
        disaster such as a hurricane.  The goal was to reduce the time between
        when someone notified the Corps of roof damage to when a tarp was
        placed.  The program was not used again until 2017, when it was
        deployed to Florida and Puerto Rico, where the app worked as intended
        and cut the delay to just a couple of days.
      - I led a small team working on tools to integrate various battlefield
        sensors into a unified display.  Our work was centered around the
        common network protocol and a Google Earth-like visualization.  We
        later expanded our work to include overlying video from small aerial
        drones onto the map so soldiers could visually identify points of
        interest indicated by radar.
      - I led a team building a tradespace analysis tool for finding optimal
        vehicle designs.  An optimal vehicle design is one that can be varied
        significantly and still meet a set of baseline performance criteria.
        That way, a vehicle can be altered over time to fit specific mission
        needs and still satisfy the basic requirements.  We were able to
        increase vehicle design considerations from hundreds to hundreds of
        millions.
  - title: Software analyst
    employer: Intergraph
    time: June 2007 - June 2011
    bullets:
      - I worked on a team building the video components of a physical security
        software suite.  Our team was responsible for controlling cameras,
        displaying live video, and recording video based on external events.  I
        was primarily responsible for the backend system that commanded the
        cameras and responded to security events, though I did also work on the
        frontend system that displayed video.
      - I worked on the tool used to configure the software suite after a round
        of downsizing.  I was able to fix a number of longstanding bugs before
        handing the product off to another teammate.
  - title: Computer engineer
    employer: US Army Corps of Engineers
    time: June 2005 - June 2007
    intro: >-
      I also interned at the Corps of Engineers the summers of 2003 and 2004.
    bullets:
      - I worked on a team to develop an enterprise geospatial data repository
        for the Corps of Engineers.  In addition, I led development of an
        ArcGIS plugin to visualize the data in the repository.
      - I led the development effort to press our geospatial data repository
        into use following Hurricane Katrina.  I was given the Army Commander's
        Medal for Civilian Service as well as the ERDC Commander's Medal for
        our work on the Katrina data project.
